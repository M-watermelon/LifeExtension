# LifeExtension

This is our submission for the MVHS hackathon, intended to be an extension for chrome. Although our project is not finished, [it is viewable as a website here.](https://m-watermelon.github.io/LifeExtension/home.html)

The purpose of this chrome extension/website is to serve as a password manager and generator.

The sql credentials on this project are fake for security purposes. 
If there are 404 or error 500 messages, the server is turned off.

What works:
- Overall ui (HTML site and CSS styling, javascript for most buttons)
- Generate password button
- Add entry window alerts
- Account signup backend
- Json and sql data base
- fetcher.js, password.js



What doesn't work:
- Account signup and login front end (index.html) 
- Appending entries to database after clicking add entry
- Reload table button
- Javascript in chrome extension
