# LifeExtension

This is our submission for the MVHS hackathon, intended to be an extension for chrome. Although our project is not finished, [it is viewable as a website here.](https://m-watermelon.github.io/LifeExtension/home.html)

The purpose of this chrome extension/website is to serve as a password manager and generator.


The sql credentials on this project are fake for security purposes. 

What works:
- Overall ui (HTML site and CSS styling, javascript for most buttons)
- Generate password button
- Add entry window alerts
- Account signup backend
- Json and sql data base
- fetcher.js, password.js



What doesn't work:
- Account signup and login front end (index.html) 
- Appending entries to database after clicking add entry
- Reload table button
- Javascript in chrome extension


Please look at the screencast video, and meteahackathon.webp video. You may have to download them to view them. Meteahackathon video freezes at the end for some reason...
