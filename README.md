# LifeExtension

This is our submission for the MVHS hackathon, intended to be an extension for chrome. Although our project is not finished, [it is viewable as a website here.](https://m-watermelon.github.io/LifeExtension/home.html)

Please look to fetcher.js for the log in and actual functionality of the program. We did not have enough time to integrate the website/extension with the login.
